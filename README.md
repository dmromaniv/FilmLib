## FILMLIB - discover your favorite movie
This project is a web application that provides information about various movies. You can search for movies using their title, and the application will display a list of all matching movies along with some basic information such as the movie poster, release date. Users can then click on a particular movie to view more detailed information, such as the cast, ratings, and plot. 

This website was created using a server-side rendering (SSR) approach, which means that the initial HTML content of each page is generated on the server and then sent to the client.

You can visit the website by following this link: [FilmLIB](https://film-h4v4f6s0g-dmromaniv.vercel.app/)
